### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Hat-Trick project where users can write articles and discuss with others in the comments.

I am a full stack software engineer with experience working with JavaScript, React, Redux, Python, and Flask. My most recent project is a Flask and React/Redux based news website that utilizes AWS S3 for image scalability and dynamic posting where users can post articles and discuss with others in the comments.

In my spare time, I am a huge soccer fan, foodie, and gamer. When I'm out, you can probably find me either at my local soccer bar watching my team Arsenal with other fans or trying new cuisines at restaurants in my area.

Additional Skills - HTML, CSS, SQL, Git

As someone who has always been interested in new technologies, I've always been interested in learning to code, but it finally took the COVID years to get me to push from turning my interest and tech hobbies into an actual career. I love the problem solving aspect of software development, and I am always looking for new ways to improve and challenge myself while learning new and different technologies.
